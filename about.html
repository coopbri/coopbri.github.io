        Hello! My name is Brian Cooper. I am a recent computer science graduate
        from the University of Minnesota. I currently work as a
        developer for the National Science Foundation's

        I am interested in all sorts of things, especially computer graphics,
        machine learning, nature, physics, and philosophy. I love learning about the universe.
