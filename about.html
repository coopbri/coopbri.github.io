          Hello! My name is Brian Cooper. I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota (December 2019) with a BS Computer Science degree accomodating an artificial intelligence emphasis. I currently work as a developer for the National Science Foundation's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1829708&HistoricalAwards=false">Hour of Cyberinfrastructure</a> project. My primary areas of work and study within technology are artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, and computer graphics; my work interests align heavily with the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/new-emerging-technologies-darq">DARQ</a> technology set. As a physics and math enthusiast, I've found these fields, especially graphics, to provide a gratifying medley of my interests. Beyond these areas, I am interested in many other things such as nature, metaphysics, and philosophy; I love learning about the universe. I enjoy maker/DIY projects, 3D printing, hiking, and self-hosted server solutions, including virtualization and containerization technology.
