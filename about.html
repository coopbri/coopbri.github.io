        <p>
          Hello! My name is Brian Cooper, and I am a BS Computer Science
          graduate from University of Minnesota. I am a software engineer and
          primarily work with React/React Native, TypeScript, C++, and Rust. In
          the past, I have previously worked with several research groups,
          including National Science Foundation's
          <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1829708"
            >Hour of Cyberinfrastructure</a
          >
          project. My previous work has involved various applications, such as
          creating and testing convolutional neural networks, developing
          learning activities for STEM concept lessons, and implementing
          statistical and machine learning models for geospatial problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My primary technical interests are in artificial intelligence, quantum
          computing, and computer graphics, however my interests also span into
          other fields such as nature, metaphysics, and philosophy; I love
          learning about the universe. Having foundational interests in math,
          science (especially physics), and creative expression, I've found deep
          enjoyment in being able to create incredible things with a pen and
          paper, a computer, and some imagination. I enjoy maker/DIY projects,
          3D printing, hiking, gardening, and self-hosted server solutions,
          including virtualization and containerization technology.
        </p>
