        Hi there! My name is Brian Cooper. I am a college student, designer, and programmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently a computer science and mathematics student at Colorado State University.
        I am an open-source advocate, and love blockchain technology; I am a big fan of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> platform in particular.
        I plan on concentrating my degree on cryptography and blockchain applications, although I am also energetically intrigued by the fields of bioinformatics and
        computational neuroscience. I believe that the human mind and the universe have the intrinsic ability to, with the right thought patterns,
        produce a symbiosis that provides a sense of direction. Because of this, I like to hold an open-minded, neuroplastic mindset of wide scope and allow the
        aforementioned mind-universe relationship to lead the way in my decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the earliest time my memory provides, I have been insatiably curious. I love learning all sorts of concepts from many different fields because of the
        remarkable ability it has to subconsciously shape my perspectives of the universe. Throughout my lifetime, I have found myself able to perceive things
        through many different dynamics thanks to an aggregation of knowledge from domains such as metaphysics, biology, quantum mechanics, cosmology, and philosophy.
        I read books from a large range of topics and like to stay busy with a course on Udemy or Coursera in my free time.
      </p>
