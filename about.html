        <p>Hello! My name is Brian Cooper, and I received a BS Computer Science degree from University of Minnesota. My primary interests are in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and computer graphics, however my interests also span into other fields such as nature, metaphysics, and philosophy; I love learning about the universe. Having foundational interests in math, science (especially physics), and creative expression, I've found deep enjoyment in being able to create incredible things with a pen and paper, a computer, and some imagination.</p>

        <p>I am an open-source advocate, and closely follow projects that advocate personal freedom.</p>

        <p>Check out my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/coopbri">LinkedIn profile</a>,
        or take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/coopbri">programming portfolio on GitHub</a>.</p>
